[BassNimbus-Live Site](https://bassnimbus.herokuapp.com)

BassNimbus is a clone of the popular music web application Soundcloud. Users of the site are able to browse songs and user pages while listening to music. Users are also able to upload, edit, and delete songs on their own profile. BassNimbus is a fullstack application that uses Ruby on Rails as a backend API, PostgreSQL & AWS S3 for databases, and React with Redux for the frontend architecture. Components such as modals and the music player were all built from scratch.
